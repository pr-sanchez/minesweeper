# Minesweeper v.1

Hello there! This Minesweeper video game it's a personal project I built in order to test my knowledge of React hooks, Unit testing and how to build a React app with webpack from scratch.

# Project

It's a "copy" of the Minesweeper game coded at my way, I'll be updating this project during these months until I feel good with my code structure, in terms of, readability, reusability and good practices in React.js and JavaScript.

# App

For now, it's in GithubPages, but soon I'll move it to Firebase because GithubPages don't support SPAs natively.
