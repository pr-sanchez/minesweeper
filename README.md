# Minesweeper v.1

Hello there! This Minesweeper video game it's a personal project I built in order to test my knowledge of React hooks, Unit testing and how to build a React app with webpack from scratch.

# Project

I'ts a "copy" of the Minesweeper game do it at my way, I'll be updating this project during these months until I feel good with my code structure, readability, reusability and good practices in React.js and JavaScript.

# App

For now it's in GithubPages, but soon i'll move it to firebase because GithubPages don't support SPAs natively.
